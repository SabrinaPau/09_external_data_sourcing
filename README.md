# External data sourcing
In this repository you're going to learn how to import external data and save it to your database to extend your existing data.

## Why external data sourcing?
In order to make the best decisions, data is vital. Having extensive and detailed data available enables sophisticated analyses and allows to predict the future more accurately. To facilitate this, a Data Analyst needs to be able to not only work with internal data but also with data from different external sources. They need to be able to access different data storages such as other databases or APIs, import, clean and prepare the data and ultimately make it available to all relevant stakeholders by adding it to existing internal data sources.

## Part 1: Add carriers to the database
1. Import data that is stored online in a csv directly from the web into python
2. Store the data into an existing database
<br></br>
## Part 2: Add aircrafts to the database
1. Download data stored in a zip file to your local file storage using python
2. Unpack the contents of the zip file with python
3. Apply data transformation and cleaning
4. Combine data from multiple files
5. Subset aircraft data based on existing data in database
6. Store data into an existing database
<br></br>
## Part 3: Get weather data from API in Python
1. OpenWeather API's available data and limitations
2. Use your API key to make your first call to the OpenWeather API
3. Adjust your API calls to get the data you need
4. Access and extract data from your JSON
5. Flatten nested JSON data and transform it into a DataFrame for future analysis
6. Make multiple calls to the API with different parameters in an automated way
