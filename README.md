# Working with APIs in Python

In this repository you're going to

1. Learn about OpenWeather API's available data and limitations
2. Use your API key to make your first call to the OpenWeather API
3. Learn how to adjust your API calls to get the data you need
4. Learn how to access and extract data from your JSON
5. Learn how to flatten nested JSON data and transform it into a DataFrame for future analysis
6. Learn how to making multiple calls to the API with different parameters in an automated way

## Objective
As a Data Analyst it is necessary to be able to import data from different data sources. Data is often stored in APIs therefore being able to connect to an API and retrieve its data is an invaluable skill.

## Task 

Before we start, activate your nf_base environment. 

Please work in pairs through all the notebooks.
