    "# Pulling Data from APIs\n",
    "As a Data Analyst, there are usually two scenarios in which you will have to work with APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to analyse or build reporting on your organization's data that is only available via one or multiple APIs\n",
    "2. You want to enrich your organization's data with external data to improve decision making and drive business value\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, being able to connect to and query from APIs is an invaluable skill and will make you more flexible when it comes to working with different data sources. We know working with APIs can be overwhelming and in order to spare you unnecessary frustration, this notebook will provide you with a structured step-by-step approach to make working with APIs as easy and fun as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will get to know the OpenWeather API https://openweathermap.org/. The goal will be to enrich our existing flights' data with additional weather data in the next notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you're going to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn about OpenWeather API's available data and limitations\n",
    "2. Sign-up to the OpenWeather API (if not already done yet)\n"

    "APIs all work very similar in that they use standard methods to make it easy to request and use data. Apart from their functionality, APIs can differ in multiple ways such as the type, amount, level of granularity and accuracy of the data, the authentication method, how many calls can be send per second/minute/day/in total annd the rules on using and publishing the data.\n",

One day your boss is in full rage mode, because it rained on her way back from the lunch break and she got wet. The only thing that can safe her day is her beloved chocolate pudding she put in the fridge in the morning. Unfortunately, you ate it, because as chance would have it, you hate your boss even more. Your boss orders you into her office and she is furious. She tells you the following: \"If I ever get wet from rain again, I will fire you.\" Oh no, this is not what you had in mind. You can't get fired, you have to pay aliments for 4 children from 5 ex-wives every month. Fortunately, you are smart and have an idea: you want to write a little app that queries the weather forecast from the OpenWeather API and sends your boss a push notification whenever it is about to rain. In order to get the most recent and accurate forecast and to minimise the risk of getting fired you plan on querying the API every second. Because you're poor you want to use the free API plan.\n",
