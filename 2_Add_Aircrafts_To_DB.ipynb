The approach we used with the type_eng column will not work with the current format of the column and ids. There is no reason to get demotivated though, this points us to a more efficient and secure way to fill data based on ids. First, let's create a dictionary to capture the ids and type names. Similar to before, use the documentation file to get the values and this time type them into a dictionary."
