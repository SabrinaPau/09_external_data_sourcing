    "When you type www.google.de into your web browser and press enter, your browser will send a request to the server that is hosting google's website, asking to retrieve the contents of the website so it can display it to you. Getting data from APIs works in a similar way. A request is sent to the address of the API, but instead of returning html and javascript files that will be interpreted and rendered by you browser, almost always a JSON file with data is returned. Also while you could use a web browser to send the request, it's not needed and more convenient to use a programming language like Python to do it.\n",
